# Researches platform api
## this project is an API built using Flask and mysql that provides a platform where researchers can post their researches.In addition to this they can see,like and comment  posts written by other researchers.

To use the project follow the following steps (assuming you have mysql installed) :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohamedhdo/Researches_platform
cd Researches_platform
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After this, create a database in your local machine and run the tables_creation_script to create the tables (Don't forget to change the database informations at the beggining of main.py).

And then you should be able to run the project.

<b>Note</b>: the API is not documented yet (coming soon)
